## Features 

- __Gameplay__

  There is no navigation on this site as the website is just a simple game for the user to enjoy. The player chooses from one of the 5 options.
  after the selection, a random number is generated to simulate the cpu turn and depending the selections. a outcome will be determined via switch statement and nested   if statements
  
  also as the player hovers over there selection, their selection will be increase in size to give the player some feedback as to their selection.

## Features Left to Implement

-__better design__
  I would have like to have worked on the CSS more as it is something that I struggle with and would have liked to add alot more flare and finese. (will come back to     improve it)
  would like to add sound effects and other such feedback for the user, maybe some animations to show the result of each hand.
